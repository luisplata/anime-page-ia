The current implementation already follows the flow you've described. Let me break down how it works:

1.  **URL Parsing**: When a user navigates to a URL like `/ver/chotto-dake-ai-ga-omoi-dark-elf-ga-isekai-kara-oikaketekita/5`:
    *   The Next.js router in `src/pages/ver/[animeId]/[episodeNumber].tsx` captures:
        *   `animeId` as `"chotto-dake-ai-ga-omoi-dark-elf-ga-isekai-kara-oikaketekita"` (which is the slug).
        *   `episodeNumber` as `"5"`.

2.  **Data Fetching in `getStaticProps`** (inside `src/pages/ver/[animeId]/[episodeNumber].tsx`):
    *   The `animeId` (slug) is passed to the `getAnimeDetail(animeId)` function.
    *   The `episodeNumber` string is parsed into an integer.

3.  **Fetching Anime Details (`getAnimeDetail` in `src/services/anime-api.ts`):**
    *   The `getAnimeDetail` function takes the `animeId` (slug) and makes an API call to `{{endpoint}}/api/anime/${animeId}`. For your example, this would be `{{endpoint}}/api/anime/chotto-dake-ai-ga-omoi-dark-elf-ga-isekai-kara-oikaketekita`.
    *   This API call is expected to return the details for that specific anime, including a list of all its episodes (as per the JSON structure you provided, where the root object has an `episodes` array).

4.  **Selecting the Specific Episode (back in `getStaticProps`):**
    *   Once `getAnimeDetail` returns the `anime` object (which includes `anime.episodes`), the code finds the specific episode:
        ```javascript
        const currentEpisode = anime.episodes.find(ep => ep.episodeNumber === episodeNumber) || null;
        ```
        This line will look for an episode in the `anime.episodes` array where `episodeNumber` matches the number from the URL (e.g., 5).

5.  **Rendering the Page**:
    *   The fetched `anime` details and the `currentEpisode` data are then passed as props to the `EpisodePlayerPage` component for rendering.

This flow matches your requirement: the page consults the endpoint using the anime slug (`chotto-dake-ai-ga-omoi-dark-elf-ga-isekai-kara-oikaketekita`) to get the anime data, and then it identifies and uses episode number 5 from that data.

No changes are required as the current implementation already adheres to this logic.
